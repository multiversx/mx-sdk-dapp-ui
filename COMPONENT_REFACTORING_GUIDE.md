# Component Refactoring Guide: Framework Components to Reusable Functions

## Core Concept
Convert framework-specific components to framework-agnostic function components for better reusability and maintainability.

## Refactoring Principles

### 1. Location Strategy
**Move from framework-specific to shared location**
- Extract components from framework directories to common/shared directories
- This signals the component is reusable across the application

### 2. Architecture Transformation
**Convert from class-based to function-based**
- Remove framework decorators and class structure
- Create pure functions with explicit prop interfaces

### 3. Dependency Elimination
**Remove external dependencies**
- Convert external stylesheets to style objects
- Replace framework-specific event systems with simple callbacks

### 4. Interface Clarity
**Use explicit TypeScript interfaces**
- Define clear prop contracts instead of framework decorators
- Include event handlers as function callbacks

### 5. Style Organization
**Group related styles logically**
- Convert framework-specific styling to organized style objects

## General Process

1. **Relocate** component to shared directory
2. **Convert** class-based to function-based architecture
3. **Eliminate** external style dependencies
4. **Simplify** event handling to function callbacks
5. **Update** all usage sites to new interface
6. **Verify** functionality and build success

## Success Criteria

- Component can be imported and used anywhere
- No external dependencies remain
- All functionality preserved
- Code is more readable and maintainable
